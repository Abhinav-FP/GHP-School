            This was the dream nurtured by Shri Gopal Sharma and today this
            dream has materialised and is taking shape in the form of our
            school. He was born in Jaipur on 8th July, 1938 to an educationist
            father, Shri Chandra Bhan Sharma and a pious mother Smt. Durga Devi
            Sharma. After a humble beginning he rose to carve a niche in the
            society.

            Qualities like fearlessness and honesty were deep-rooted in his mind
            from early childhood. After his initial schooling in Jaipur, he
            completed his formal education from Mumbai University. Editor,
            theatre personality, social worker and a successful business person,
            all rolled into one, he was a multi-faceted man with numerous
            talents.

            A hard-working and resourceful person, he was determined to make a
            mark in the field of education. He firmly believed in the concept
            that quality education should be imparted to all and this resulted
            in the birth of Powai English School at Powai.
