In our primary classes, 'hands-on' learning is essential for developing lifelong competencies. Following the RBSE curriculum, we design activities that cater to children's interestsâ€”communication, inquiry, construction, and artistic expression. Aligned with our philosophy, "Let learning be a joy and teaching a pleasure," we enrich education through field trips, experiments, hobbies, and life skills, aiming to develop each child's potential and prepare them for a rapidly evolving world.`,
